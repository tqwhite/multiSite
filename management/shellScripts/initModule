No, this isn't a real script. It's a reminder of the commands to do things

zf create module siteMap
zf create controller Generate 1 siteMap
zf create action Container Generate 1 siteMap

Don't forget to change this controller segment:

extends Q_Controller_Base
{
    public function init() //this is called by the Zend __construct() method
    {
        parent::init(array('controllerType'=>'cms'));
    }
