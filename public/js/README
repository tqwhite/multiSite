=================================================Original Layouts

* contactFooter.phtml
* layout.phtml
* minimal.phtml
* nonCmsData.phtml
* siteDirectory.phtml

Uses this javascript:

jquery - javascript mvc code base
steal - javascript mvc app builder code

widgets - TQ White II's widget library

Note: jquery-1.6.4.js is called by these layouts.


=================================================
In May 2015, a new layout strategy was added


* scroll-feature-default.phtml

It uses this javascript:

require.js
vendor
	foundation
	foundation.min.js
	other external libraries
fidgets
	whatever TQ writes that uses the stuff

Note: jQuery2 is in the vendor folder. These layouts do *not* 
use jquery-1.6.4.js or anything else in the js/ folder. Except for those three things,
the rest is used by the previous, widgets era code.
