SLIDESHOW ELEMENT: edit slideShow/b_demoSlide to customize<br/>
<br/>
remember:<br/>
<br/>
1) You can put images in the images directory. Show them in the normal way: &lt;img src='images/imageFileName.pnh'&gt;<br/>
2) You can add additional .html files into the slideShow directory if you need more slides.<br/>
3) Slides are shown in the same order they appear in the file system, ie, alphabetically. Hence, the prefix 'b_'.
